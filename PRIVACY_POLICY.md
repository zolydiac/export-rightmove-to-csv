# Privacy Policy — Export Rightmove to CSV

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Summary
Export Rightmove to CSV processes property listing data **locally on your device**. We do not collect, store, or transmit your Rightmove search data to our servers.

## Data We Process

### Property Listing Data
- **What:** Property details visible on Rightmove search results pages (address, price, bedrooms, etc.)
- **Where processed:** Entirely within your browser, on your device
- **Stored:** When you export to CSV (saved to your local downloads folder) and when you use the "Save" feature (stored in your browser's local extension storage)
- **Sent externally:** Never. No listing data leaves your device.

### Saved Properties
- **What:** Properties you choose to save, including any status, tags, and notes you add
- **Where stored:** Locally in `chrome.storage.local` on your device
- **Sent externally:** Never. Your saved properties, notes, and tags never leave your device.

### License / Payment Status
- **What:** We use ExtensionPay to manage Pro license status (paid/unpaid).
- **Data exchanged with ExtensionPay:** Only what is required to verify your Pro status (a license identifier and paid/unpaid status). No Rightmove data or browsing history is sent.
- **Payments:** Billing details are handled by ExtensionPay/Stripe on their checkout pages, not by this extension.
- **ExtensionPay privacy policy:** https://extensionpay.com/privacy

### Usage Counters
