# Privacy Policy — Export Rightmove to CSV

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Summary
Export Rightmove to CSV processes property listing data **locally on your device**. We do not collect, store, or transmit your Rightmove search data to our servers.

## Data We Process

### Property Listing Data
- **What:** Property details visible on Rightmove search results pages (address, price, bedrooms, etc.)
- **Where processed:** Entirely within your browser, on your device
- **Stored:** Only when you export to CSV (saved to your local downloads folder)
- **Sent externally:** Never. No listing data leaves your device.

### License / Payment Status
- **What:** We use ExtensionPay to manage Pro license status (paid/unpaid).
- **Data exchanged with ExtensionPay:** Only what is required to verify your Pro status (e.g., a license/account identifier and paid/unpaid status). No Rightmove data or browsing history is sent.
- **Payments:** Any billing details you enter are handled by ExtensionPay/Stripe on their checkout pages, not by this extension.

### Usage Counters

- **Where stored:** Locally in `chrome.storage.local` on your device.
- **Sent externally:** Never.
